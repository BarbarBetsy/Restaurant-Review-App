# Restaurant Reviews App

## What it is

The app lets you choose from a couple of restaurants in the hippest city in the world. Pick a neighborhood or the kind of food you like and see where the next place to be is located.

## What I did

The basic structure of the app was given by Udacity.
I made the app responsive, better usable for screenreaders and without a mouse. And I installed a ServiceWorker so that the app can be used when offline.

## Dependencies
jQuery
